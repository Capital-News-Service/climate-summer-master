  <p>As global warming continues to increase the atmosphere’s temperature, cold snaps persist in cities like Baltimore and won’t vanish anytime soon.</p><br>

  <p>Extremely cold weather will remain a factor in the Northeast because of disruptions in the polar vortex, a phenomenon that pushes cold arctic air into the United States. Because cold snaps will occur in the future, <b class="orange">Baltimore can’t ignore the effects of freezing temperatures on its residents.</b></p><br>

  <p>There are common misconceptions about the relationship between the warming of the atmosphere and the frequency of cold snaps. A warmer climate doesn’t cause extreme cold weather to become extinct, said Judah Cohen, the Director of Seasonal Forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. </p><br>

  <p>“There is this generalized warming of the planet that would decrease extreme winter weather,” Cohen said. </p> <br>

  <p>“But also on the other hand, there are more frequent disruptions of the polar vortex which would increase [it], so it's kind of a tug-of-war between the two.”</p><br>

  <p class="initial-classical">The number of sub-freezing days in Baltimore have stayed relatively constant, even as average winter temperatures rise. Days that dipped below 20 degrees and 10 degrees, however, do appear to be occurring at a less frequent rate. </p><br>

  <p>Freezing days haven’t gone away because of the climate change effects on the polar vortex. The polar vortex consists of air masses located above the North and South Pole that contain trapped cold air. </p><br>

  <p>Due to the warming of the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere that lies above the one we live in — the polar vortex weakens and can break into multiple sections. This allows the cold air that was once contained in the vortex to escape the poles and move extreme cold temperatures to lower latitudes, such as the continental United States. </p><br>

<br>
      <p>The impact from these disruptions could last anywhere from 4-to-8 weeks, according to Cohen, a wide range that makes it difficult to predict how long future cold snaps will be.</p>

      <p>“You may get a cold snap like we had with that polar vortex event in late January in the upper Midwest, where they had that historic cold then it moderating quickly, so that's more typical,” Cohen said. “We think of it as more episodic, but there are cases where it's been continuous when the pattern gets locked and it doesn't change."</p>
      <p>In Baltimore, there isn’t an indication that cold snap longevity is changing. The occurrence of three-day-long cold snaps with a minimum temperature below 32 degrees are just as sporadic as previous years. </p>

<br>

    <p>Cold snaps that occur in places that usually experience winter weather such as the Northeastern United States, northern Europe and East Asia are the result of polar vortex disruptions, according to Cohen. When winter extremes occur in other locations, experts consider these events unexplainable.</p>

    <p class="caption">Over the past five years, over 30% of all cold-related deaths in Maryland have occurred in Baltimore City.</p>

    <p>This winter, snowfall hit Maui, Hawaii at its lowest elevation ever. Meanwhile, Seattle recorded record-breaking temperatures and Las Vegas had snowfall for the first time in over a decade.</p>

    <p>“They [disruptions] could maybe bring a rare event, but it is much harder to attribute something like one snowfall in Vegas to something on a climate scale,” Cohen said. “Things randomly do happen from time to time."</p>

      <p>Scientists find it even more difficult to assess what’s a random weather event and what’s a direct result of global warming, such as the cold snap in January that reached the lowest temperatures in the Midwest in the past 25 years.</p>

<p>“How do you determine if that's an indication of a changing climate and not just the weather event?” said Tim Canty, an oceanic and atmospheric professor at the University of Maryland. “That's the trick and that's a question among climate communities.”

      <p>What experts do know is that sporadic winter weather will continue, including in the city of Baltimore. Over the past 30 years, there’s been a consistent appearance of cold snaps in the Northeastern U.S. In the years to come, the pattern is not expected to change, according to Cohen.</p>

    <p class="caption">During periods of extremely cold weather, the Baltimore Health Commissioner declares a Code Blue Extreme Cold Alert and the city opens warming centers, which are community locations like libraries and senior centers where residents can go to warm up. However, many of the warming centers have limited hours or aren’t open daily.</p>




      <p>Even as the atmosphere’s temperature continues to gradually increase, residents must not dismiss cold snaps when experiencing warmer winters. Extreme cold weather events have always happened, are still happening and show no signs of completely disappearing, despite a decrease in extremely cold days. </p>

      <p class="caption">The Maryland Public Service Commission collects monthly reports from Maryland power companies like Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) that show the number of low-income customers whose power is turned off. Customers are defined as low-income if they receive bill payment assistance. Due to weather restrictions that make turning power off during the winter more difficult, most turn-offs occur between April and October, peaking in October with about 16 percent of total shut-offs occurring during that month.</p>

</div>


      <p>“And the difficulties with this and trying to get people to care about this is … we had this massive cold snap this year,” Canty said. “But what about if next year it's 70 degrees all winter long and everyone's happy about that?"
