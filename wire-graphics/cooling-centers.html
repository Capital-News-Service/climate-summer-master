      <div class="chart-description">The Baltimore City Health Department has 12 locations designated as permanent cooling centers during periods of extreme heat. Five are community action partnerships, and seven are senior centers. Baltimore City's health commissioner declared a Code Red Extreme Heat Alert for July 17 through July 21. During this time, an additional 12 cooling centers were opened throughout the city. On the map, these additional centers are represented by red dots. Eight of them were recreational centers, and four of them were senior centers. During the July heatwave, four of the permanent cooling centers extended their hours. Most of the 24 centers were closed Saturday and Sunday, the most intense days of the July heat wave. Despite there being a total of 24 cooling centers open across the July heatwave, the closest one to McElderry Park was approximately a mile away on East Chase Street. The closest senior center cooling location was a half mile away in the 2600 block of East Baltimore Street. </div><br>
