      <div class="chart-description">During periods of extreme heat, the Baltimore Health Department designates some government-owned buildings as cooling centers. When Baltimoreâ€™s health commissioner declared a Code Red emergency July 16-22, the city opened even more buildings to supplement the usual locations. The closest one to McElderry Park was about a mile away, on East Chase Street. The closest senior center cooling location, a half -mile away in the 2600 block of East Baltimore Street, was not open on the weekend. </div><br>
