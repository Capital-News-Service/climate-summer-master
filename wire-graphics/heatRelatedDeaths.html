      <div class="chart-description">There were 134 heat-related deaths recorded in Maryland between 2012 and 2018. Thirty-seven of those deaths (28%) occurred in Baltimore, which is home to only about 10% of Maryland's population. Maryland recorded 46 heat-related deaths in 2012, when the United States was hit with one of the most severe heat waves in modern American history. There were 28 heat-related deaths in Maryland in 2018, 13 of which occurred in Baltimore. Many of those deaths occurred during a heat wave that hit Maryland in July of that year.</div><br>
